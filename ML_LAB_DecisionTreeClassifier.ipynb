    "In this lab, we will once again construct a machine learning model that predict the species of an iris based on its pedal and sepal dimensions. This time, we will use another approach in the supervised learning toolboxâ€“the decision tree, instead of using the support vector machine like the last lan we worked on. \n",

    "Beginning with the root node, every node that is not a leave node acts as a decision node in the tree. In its essence, a decision tree architecture is where we do a greedy search to find the optimal split point in a tree. The decision nodes are where the data is split, and the leave nodes represents outputs like a class label. \n",
